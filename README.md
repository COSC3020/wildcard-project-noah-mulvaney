# Wildcard Project

I attempted a comparison of the different implementations for finding the Fibonacci numbers covered in this course. I copied the implementations from previous exercises and the slides. I then tried to run them with different input sizes to compare their time complexity. With the time available, I could not find a way to measure the time with enough precision to get an useful comparison. I also implemented a closed-form formula for the Fibonacci numbers using the golden ratio based on our discussion in MATH3700 Combinatorics of linear recurrences. It has a constant time complexity, which is very neat.
